# Time Series Analysis with Pandas

This **[Time Series Analysis with Pandas](time_series_analysis.ipynb)** contains Python code snippets demonstrating various time series analysis techniques using Pandas library. Below is a summary of what you'll find in this repository:

## Content Overview

1. Introduction to Time Series:
   - Explanation of time series data and its applications.
   - Examples of different types of time series data.

2. Manipulating Time Series with Pandas:
   - Working with `Timestamp`, `DatetimeIndex`, and `Timedelta` objects.
   - Real-life examples of time series manipulation with Pandas.

3. Analyzing Time Series Data:
   - Loading and preprocessing financial (Google stock prices) and YouTube engagement data.
   - Creating additional time-related features such as month names, weekday names, and quarters.
   - Visualizing time series data using line plots and bar plots.

4. Resampling, Rolling Windows, and Shifting:
   - Demonstrating resampling for downsampling and upsampling.
   - Using rolling windows for smoothing time series data.
   - Shifting time series data to compare values at different time points.

5. Example Application - Login Data Analysis:
   - Analyzing user login data to calculate average time between logins for a specific user.
